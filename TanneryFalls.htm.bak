            <P class=FallsDescription align=left>Tannery Falls is the original 
            name for these falls, which are now part of a nature preserve owned 
            by the Michigan Nature Association (MNA). The MNA has renamed them 
            Olson Falls in honor of Rudolph M. Olson. I don't know whether the 
            new name will stick or not. It all depends on what people get used 
            to, I suppose. Tannery Falls is the name listed in the <A

            Survey Geographic Names Information System</A> database. </P>

            <P class=FallsDescription align=left>To get to Tannery Falls, take 
            Munising Avenue east out of downtown Munising. Going east, Munising 
            Avenue is the same as H-58. You don't have to go far. Look for the 
            the intersection where Washington Street goes off to your left. 
            Washington Street takes you towards the hospital and the <A 
            href="http://michiganwaterfalls.com/munising_falls/munising_falls.html">Munising 
            Falls</A> Visitor Center. On your right, just before you get to 
            Washington Street, you'll see a stairway leading from the roadside 
            up into the woods. You should see a bridge as well, but the stairway 
            is closer to town, and it's the stairway that leads to these 
            falls.</P>
            <P class=FallsDescription align=left><B>Do not park on H-58 to visit 
            Tannery Falls!</B> You'll get a parking ticket. I learned this the

            good bet.</P>

            <H2 class=FallsSubHead align=left>The Hike In</H2>
            <P class=FallsDescription align=left>Climb the steps, and just after 
            you get to the top, look down and to your left. You should see a 
            memorial marker embedded in concrete with the name Rudolph M. Olson, 
            and the dates 1909-1982. One of these days I'm going to phone the 
            MNA and find out the story behind this. </P>
            <P class=FallsDescription align=left>From here to the falls it's 
            just a matter of following the trail. Do be careful of falling 
            debris. Much of the time the trail follows the cliff side. I've 
            never witnessed anything falling myself, but there's ample evidence 
            of it. On a trip in December 2000, I saw several trees that had 
            fallen over the edge of the cliff and onto the trail. These had not 
            been there when I visited in May of that same year. If you're 
            visiting in the winter, be especially careful of the ice. You 
            wouldn't want a falling icicle to land on your head. That may sound 
            funny, but there is a real danger. Falling ice is heavy.</P>

            <H2 class=FallsSubHead align=left>At the Falls</H2>
            <P class=FallsDescription align=left>When you get to the falls 
            themselves, you'll see that the stream has undercut the cliff. You 
            can easily walk around behind the falls if you don't mind getting 
            your feet wet. If you're careful, you may even be able to stay dry. 
            To your right as you approach the falls will be a smaller falls 
            about waist-high that may be manmade. I suspect they may be manmade, 
            because there is a six-inch brown pipe extending out from these. I 
            have no idea why the pipe is there. Someday, hopefully, I'll meet 
            someone who has lived nearby long enough to know the reason for this 
            pipe.</P>
            <P class=FallsDescription align=left>Right smack in the middle of 
            the trail, just in front of the falls, is a large pile of dirt and 
            rubble. The trail goes up to the top of this, and I think it's ok to 
            walk up it, but otherwise try to stay off the sides of this mound. 
            The nature preserve is trying to replant vegetation on the sides of 
            the mound where foot traffic has caused erosion. I suspect this 
            mound is the result of the rock walls caving in at some point in the 
            past, but I don't know how long ago that would be.</P>

            <P class=FallsDescription align=left>Tanner Falls in the winter is a 
            site to behold. I've visited once in March, and again in December. 
            Both times the falls were encased in a column of ice. You can 
            actually stand there and hear the water falling, but you can't see 
            it. At least you can't easily see it, because the water falls inside 
            the ice column. There will be some breaks here and there in the ice 
            through which you can see the spray falling. </P>

            <P class=FallsDescription align=left>Ice builds up all around the 
            bottom of the falls, and you really can't even see where the water 
            hits the ground. What you have is a column of ice coming down from 
            the top of the falls and ending in a huge mound of ice on the 
            ground. The stream flows out from under the edges of that mound. 
</P>
            <P class=FallsDescription align=left>There's enough room in the ice 
            column that you could probably climb inside if you didn't mind 
            getting wet from the falling water. <I><B>Don't do this!</B></I> I'm 
            not suggesting you do this. It would be extremely dangerous. You 
            would be risking your life. But when I stand in front of that ice 
            column, the sound of the water is hypnotic, and it calls out to me. 
            I'm a cave explorer from way back, and to be inside a cave, next to 
            a waterfall, with the sound of falling water echoing all around is a 
            profound experience. Listening to these falls cascade down through 
            the ice reminds me of very much of caving trips gone by.</P>

            <P class=FallsDescription align=left>The bank 50-100 feet to the 
            east of the falls is climbable, but barely. I don't recommend 
            climbing the bank. It's steep, you'll cause erosion, and you'll end 
            up in someone's backyard. You'll actually be very close to the 
            parking area for <A 
            href="http://michiganwaterfalls.com/mna_memorial_falls/mna_memorial_falls.html">MNA 
            Memorial Falls</A>. The backyard you'd be in belongs to the house at 
            the very end of Nestor street. I went back there once with the 
            homeowner's permission, and it really surprised me how close Tannery 
            Falls is to Nestor Street, and to <A 
            href="http://michiganwaterfalls.com/mna_memorial_falls/mna_memorial_falls.html">MNA 
            Memorial Falls</A>. I wouldn't have guessed it based on the hike in 
            from H-58. The photo to the right shows part of Tannery Creek 
            upstream from the falls. There's actually two or three smaller falls 
            just upstream from the large one that most people visit. The largest 
            of these smaller falls is about two feet high. One is so small I'm 
            not even sure it deserves to be counted. The stream is very scenic 
            in the winter as it winds it's way through the snow. Also back in 
            this area is an apartment complex. The stream seems to run around 
            behind the apartments somehow, but I havn't followed it that far 
            yet.</P>

                  It's not clear to me when the cabin was torn down, but it 
                  surely must have been present in the 1950s when the Lukowskis 
                  built their house on the property.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
            <P class=FallsDescription align=left>Recently, I was in Wheel's, a 
            bicycle and ski shop on the corner of M-28 and Superior Street. I 
            was renting some snowshoes, and while talking with one of the owners 
            I discovered she had grown up on Nestor Street not far from Tannery 
            Falls. She told me that when she was young the falls were owned by 
            an older lady named Hettie Lukowski who charged tourists 25 cents to 
            walk back and have a look. I think the tourists got the better end 
            of that bargain—a visit to the falls is worth more than a quarter. I 
            was also told that Hettie landscaped the area very nicely. Hettie's 
            father, or perhaps father-in-law, purchased the property in 1935. 
            The site was kept in the family until the mid-1980s when it was sold 
            to the MNA, and was purposely kept undeveloped to protect the 
            beautiful site from commercialization. Sometime after the MNA 
            purchased the property, the Lukowski house was torn down. </P>
