From downtown Munising, take Munising Avenue east. It will
shortly turn into H-58. Watch for Washington Street veering
off to your left. At that intersection you'll see a wooden
stairway going into the woods on your right. Go up that
stairway and follow the trail to the falls. Do not park
on H-58! You'll get a ticket. You can park on Nestor Street,
which is just uphill from the stairway.
